- AI Act
- Contract

### 2. Document Type Filter
- Regulation
- Guideline
- Case Law
- Opinion
- Directive
- Standard

### 3. Source Filter
- EUR-Lex
- Gazzetta Ufficiale
- EDPB
- Italian Parliament
- EU Commission

- Temporal filtering on published_date

### 5. Relevance Score Filter
- Slider from 0% to 100%
- Default: 50%
- Filters results by minimum similarity score

## Faceted Search Implementation

**How it works:**
1. After each search, calculate counts for each filter option
2. Display counts next to filter options (e.g., "GDPR (45)")
3. Update counts dynamically as filters are applied
4. Show only relevant options with non-zero counts

**Performance Optimization:**
- Materialized view for pre-computed counts
- Incremental updates on document changes
- Caching of facet calculations

## Filter Presets

**Features:**
- Save current filter configuration with custom name
- Load saved presets with one click
- Set default preset (auto-loaded on page load)
- Delete unwanted presets
- Visual indication of default preset

**Use Cases:**
- "GDPR Regulations Only"
- "Recent Tax Updates"
- "High Relevance AML Documents"
- "EU Commission Sources"

## Filter Persistence

**Implementation:**
1. Save filters to user preferences in database
2. Load default preset on page mount
3. Persist active filters in URL query params (optional)
4. Restore filters on page reload

## Analytics Tracking

**Metrics Collected:**
- Filter usage frequency
- Most popular filter combinations
- Average result counts per filter
- Filter effectiveness (result count vs. relevance)
- User-specific filter patterns

**Analytics Use Cases:**
- Improve filter suggestions
- Identify popular content areas
- Optimize search relevance
- Personalize user experience

## Filter Logic

**Combination Rules:**
- Multiple selections within same filter type: OR logic
  - Example: Domain = [GDPR, Tax] → matches GDPR OR Tax
- Multiple filter types: AND logic
  - Example: Domain = [GDPR] AND Type = [Regulation] → matches both

**Example Query:**
```
Domain: GDPR, Tax
Type: Regulation
Source: EUR-Lex
Date: 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31
Min Relevance: 70%

Result: Documents that are:
- (GDPR OR Tax) AND
- Regulation AND
- EUR-Lex AND
- Published in 2023 AND
- Relevance >= 70%
```

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface with shadcn/ui components
- Color-coded filter tags (blue for domain, green for type, purple for source)
- Collapsible sections to reduce clutter
- Sticky filter panel for easy access while scrolling

### User Interactions
- One-click filter application
- Quick filter removal from summary tags
- Clear all filters button
- Preset quick-load buttons
- Expandable sections for advanced options

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly filter panel
- Touch-optimized controls
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Facet Calculation:**
   - Materialized views for pre-computed counts
   - Incremental updates instead of full recalculation
   - Caching of frequently accessed facets

2. **Database Queries:**
   - Optimized indexes for filter columns
   - Composite indexes for common filter combinations
   - Query plan optimization for complex filters

3. **Frontend:**
   - Debounced filter updates
   - Lazy loading of facet counts
   - Memoized filter state

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS):**
   - Users can only access their own presets
   - Users can only view their own analytics
   - Public documents accessible to all authenticated users

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Filter values validated against allowed options
   - Date range validation
   - SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Prevent abuse of filter analytics tracking
   - Limit preset creation per user
