npm run test

# Run search tests
npx playwright test tests/search.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run with coverage
npm run test -- --coverage
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test search performance
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=GDPR" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n"

# Test embedding service
curl -X POST "https://your-service.railway.app/api/embed" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"test query"}' \
  -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n"
```

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Test semantic search function
SELECT * FROM search_documents_semantic(
  (SELECT embedding FROM documents LIMIT 1),
  0.5,
  10
);

-- Check cache statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_entries,
  SUM(hit_count) as total_hits,
  AVG(hit_count) as avg_hits
FROM search_cache;

-- Verify indexes
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname,
  indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'documents';
```
